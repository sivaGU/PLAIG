Welcome to the GitHub repository for PLAIG: <u>**P**</u>rotein-<u>**L**</u>igand Binding <u>**A**</u>ffinity Prediction using a Novel <u>**I**</u>nteraction-Based <u>**G**</u>raph Neural Network Framework. PLAIG can predict the binding affinity for protein-ligand complexes.  
Please click on the link in the **About section to access additional documentation and the demo program**. Users can test PLAIG with their own protein-ligand complex files or download example files in the demo_file directory. **Please give the Demo page a couple minutes to fully load.**
