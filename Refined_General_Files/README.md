## Directions for Downloading Files for the General and Refined Set Demo

There are two .zip files in this directory. In order to run the general and refined set demo, you must first 
download the RefinedSet.zip and GeneralSet.zip files. Then, unzip them, and you will see the refined/general pdb and 
pdbqt zipped folders. Inside these zipped folders are the refined and general set files for demo. Please download four 
files from the general set or four files from the refined set (2 files for the protein (.pdb and .pdbqt) and 2 files 
for the ligand (.pdb and .pdbqt). The four files must have the **same four-letter code** in the filenames for the 
prediction to run smoothly.  

general_set_pdb.zip: Contains **.pdb** files from the PDBbindv.2020 general set.  
general_set_pdbqt.zip: Contains **.pdb** files from the PDBbindv.2020 refined set.  
refined_set_pdb.zip: Contains **.pdbqt** files from the PDBbindv.2020 general set.  
refined_set_pdbqt.zip: Contains **.pdbqt** files from the PDBbindv.2020 refined set.  

Example: If I wanted to predict the binding affinity of the protein-ligand complex that has the label 11gs from the 
general set, then I would have to download four files, two from PDB_general (ligand and protein) and two from 
PDBQT_general (ligand and protein). The two files from PDB_general would be "11gs_hydrogenated_ligand.pdb" and "11gs_hydrogenated_pocket.pdb". The two files 
from PDBQT_general would be "11gs_ligand.pdbqt" and "11gs_pocket.pdbqt".
